create a react To Do style app that is a directory for 100 Days of Code projects

----- form data: -----
- day number
- title
- link to github
- link to deployed app/code pen

----- user stories: -----
the main page will list all data
only logged in user (me) can create, update, or delete

----- brainstorm: -----
create all paths
create log in page
apply auth to necessary routes

if i only want one user, do i need auth?

let's just start without auth, like JAMList

----- pseudocode: -----
set up backend express app
set up front end create-react-app
